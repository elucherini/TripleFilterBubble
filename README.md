# TripleFilterBubble

Providing reproducible simulations and analysis for the paper "The triple filter bubble: Using agent-based modelling to test a meta-theoretical framework for the emergence of filter bubbles and echo chambers" (2018) Daniel Geschke, Jan Lorenz, Peter Holtz


## Reproduce simulation runs

Use the NetLogo model (TripleFilterBubble.nlogo). 

Simulations should preferable be run in NetLogo 6.0.4. (Download free https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
Run the 12 scenarios using the provided buttons. Run them for 10.000 timesteps (this can take a while!) and compare the results. For most scenarios the numbers are approached faster and not 10.000 timesteps are needed to reproduce the stylized facts. 
    
The model also runs in NetLogoWeb in the browser but only in a simplified version (TripleFilterBubble_Web.nlogo) and much slower. Therefore the configuration is by default with lower a numbers of guys and friends and with the visualization of links switched off. Try this link:
