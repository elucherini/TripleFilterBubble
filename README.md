# TripleFilterBubble

Providing reproducible simulations and analysis for the paper "The triple filter bubble: Using agent-based modelling to test a meta-theoretical framework for the emergence of filter bubbles and echo chambers" (2018) Daniel Geschke, Jan Lorenz, Peter Holtz


## Reproduce simulation runs

Use the NetLogo model (TripleFilterBubble.nlogo). 

It should preferable be run in NetLogo 6.0.4. (Download free https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
Run the 12 scenarios using the provided buttons. Run them 10.000 timesteps (this can take a while!) and compare the results. 

    
It also runs in NetLogoWeb (much slower) in the browser but only in a simplified version. Examples are with lower numbers of guys and friends here. Try this link:
